It is work team Jester.
We are the Jester team, and we are excited to present an innovative question-and-answer system specifically designed for interpreting and analyzing technical documentation. This solution enables users to quickly find answers to complex technical questions using the power of machine learning.

With our system, technical specialists (primarily mobile developers) can efficiently obtain the necessary information from the provided database of documentation, significantly speeding up the development process and eliminating errors caused by incorrect interpretation of text.

Our solution's technology stack includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bash, and ML. The uniqueness of our system lies in the use of pre-trained deep learning models, which ensures high accuracy and relevance of answers, even when working with limited data.

Now, everyone can access deep knowledge from technical literature, making the development process more intelligent and productive.
